# TelegramInventoryBot_2017
Automized Telegram APP I created during my Automato Inc. internship. It assists the office manager in keeping track of and ordering office products. I built both the admin side and server side. Tested using iOS iPhone and Google Browser. 

Tools Used in no particular order: Telegram API's, JS, MongoDB, TextEditor(Sublime)
