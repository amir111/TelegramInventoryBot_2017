# TelegramInventoryBot_2017
I created a Telegram Inventory Bot at my Automato Inc. internship which assited the office manager in keeping track of and ordering office products. I built both the admin side and user side. Tested using iOS phone and Google Browser. 

Tools Used in no particular order: Telegram API's, JS, MongoDB, TextEditor(Sublime)
